- research:
  - {} notation that can be used to put var in
  - npm install globally
  


- require() function
  - need to put module.exports = 'something' inside the js file so the require() will return that something
  - how to use require():
    - in the export file: include module.exports('path')
    - in the import file: var name = require('path')
