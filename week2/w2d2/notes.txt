- what is a server?
  - a port allows us to run multiple server on a single host (choose between 1024 - 65535)

- Expess.js
  - define a middle ware -> app.use(express.static('public')) - to handle all the static requests so we dont have to do get request for every request
    ? why is public being used
    * try to understand this one, this is important
    - middle ware example:
      ///
      app.use((request, response next) => {
        response.local.agent
      })

- EJS
  - express uses 'views' as the name of the folder to store all the .ejs files
  - <%= %> to put js into the middle of html in ejs
    - if we dont want to write anything to the html, we dont use the '=' after %, if we want that js to be displayed on the html file, use the '='

- ES6
  - 'use strict' 
    - put at the beginning of the file to set the whole file into strict mode
    - put at the beginning of each function to set that function to strict mode only - good for debugging
  - be careful when use this in => function, should not use
  - const obj = {
    first: 1,
    second: 2,
    third: 3
    } 
    const {first, second} = obj // will find the keys in obj and assign the value to the new const
